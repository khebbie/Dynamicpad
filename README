DynamicPad is a play project to mimic linqpad, only for dynamic languages.
IronRuby is the language of DynamicPad for now, other languages might follow as needed
I use Massive from Rub Connery to include data access.

With that you can do sql queries:

result = tbl.All()
outp = ""
result.each do |bovs| 
	outp = outp + bovs.firstname
	outp = outp + bovs.lastname
	outp = outp + bovs.birthdate.ToString()
	outp = outp + "\n"
end
p outp

You can also do templated queries, where you use objects to specify the query:
x = tbl.Prototype

x.firstname = "Klaus"

DumpE tbl.Query("person".ToString(), x)

If you wan't to do your own stuff, you can inherit Massives DynamicModel and do your own stuff:
class MyModel < Massive::DynamicModel
	def GetStuff
		 Query("select * from Person Where firstname ='Klaus'".ToString())
	end	
end

m = MyModel.new(connString, "Person")
#DumpE m.GetStuff
#DumpE m.All
p m.Count.ToString()

s = m.Single("firstname = 'Søren'".ToString())
Dump s

RoadMap>
The plan is to add IronJs (maybe some coffeescript), IronPython and IronRuby support to create a kind of REPL/console application

Please note that this is a prototype - the architecture of this app is bad :-(
