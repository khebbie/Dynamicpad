Dynamic is a play project to mimic linqpad, only for dynamic languages.
The plan is to add IronJs (maybe some coffeescript), IronPython and IronRuby support to create a kind of REPL/console application

Please note that this is a prototype - the architecture of this app is bad :-(

Found some inspiration here>
